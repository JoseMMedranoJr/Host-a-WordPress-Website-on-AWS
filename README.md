## Introduction

This project showcases a web application hosted on AWS. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of various AWS services to deploy and manage a web application. The application is built using [technology stack, e.g., React, Node.js, etc.], and leverages AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, and more.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./path/to/architecture-diagram.png)

### Components:
- **Frontend**: Hosted on S3 and served via CloudFront.
- **Backend**: Deployed on EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling group.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS for data storage.
- **Storage**: S3 for static assets and user uploads.
- **Load Balancer**: AWS ELB to distribute incoming traffic.
- **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

## Features

- Scalable and resilient architecture using AWS services.
- Continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
- Secure authentication and authorization.
- RESTful API for backend services.
- Responsive and interactive user interface.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed for infrastructure as code (optional)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed for frontend and backend development

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies
#### Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure AWS Services
- Create an S3 bucket for the frontend and configure it for static website hosting.
- Set up RDS for the backend database.
- Create EC2 instances and configure them for the backend services.
- Configure ELB for load balancing.
- Set up IAM roles and policies for necessary permissions.

## Deployment

### Using AWS CLI
#### Frontend
```sh
aws s3 sync ./frontend s3://your-s3-bucket-name --delete
```

#### Backend
- SSH into your EC2 instance and deploy the backend services.
```sh
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-instance
cd /path/to/backend
npm start
```

### Using Terraform (Optional)
- Define your infrastructure in Terraform files.
- Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration.
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Usage

- Access the web application via the CloudFront URL or the S3 bucket URL for the frontend.
- Use Postman or any API client to interact with the backend services via the ELB DNS.
